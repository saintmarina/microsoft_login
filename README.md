# Deviations
1. I chose to take out the text from the form completerly.
  Benefits:
  - The text "Profile creation. Use the form below to submit your portfolio" seems unnessacery if there is a company logo on top of the form. It is clear what service the user is signing up for.
  - Because of the email and password validation code, the user will understand that these two fields are required.The form won't be submitted without them. Thus the line "An email and password are required" is redundant.
2. I chose to add link "Already have an account?"
  Benefits:
  - In case the user already has an account they will be easily redirected to the "SignIn Page"
3. I chose to add "Use Other Methods"
  Benefits:
  - Some users might prefer using other platforms for signing in.
  - It will save the user some time, because the other platform will prefill the info for the user.
4. On the confirmation page, I chose to add large "Confirmed!" text with a ghapic image.
  Benefits:
  - The first thing that the user will see is the "Confirmed!" message. This will prevent the user from waisting time, if she doesn't want to read the rest of the text.
# Design 
I chose to use Google Material Library for the UI design. In addition I used a [library](https://github.com/FarhamHosseini/LoadingButton) for the circularLoadingButton.
